My issues\r\nwith their present site, at the time of this redesign, are that it looks fairly\r\noutdated and is not responsive. [The blog portion](http://blog.lifars.com) at\r\nleast loads that default Wordpress mobile theme if you come at it from your\r\nphone.\r\n\r\nUnder this version, everything's a clean design that scales. It's not yet\r\nhooked up to their blog (Wordpress). And the homepage feeds for press and\r\nblog posts have not been implemented at this time.\r\n\r\nIt's Bootstrap 3. There's a bit of Ruby (a rakefile) that can do all the\r\npre-production stuff like minification, etc. but everything runs static out of\r\nthe box.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
