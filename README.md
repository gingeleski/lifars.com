# Lifars.com Redesign
This is a new take on [the Lifars LLC website](https://lifars.com). My issues
with their present site, at the time of this redesign, are that it looks fairly
outdated and is not responsive. [The blog portion](http://blog.lifars.com) at
least loads that default Wordpress mobile theme if you come at it from your
phone.

Under this version, everything's a clean design that scales. It's not yet
hooked up to their blog (Wordpress). And the homepage feeds for press and
blog posts have not been implemented at this time.

It's Bootstrap 3. There's a bit of Ruby (a rakefile) that can do all the
pre-production stuff like minification, etc. but everything runs static out of
the box.
